             TITLE IX <br> SEXUAL HARASSMENT <br> POLICY </h1>
        <P>
            In keeping with its mission to promote the personal and professional development of all members
            of the JIMS community and to provide a safe and welcoming campus, JIMS College fosters a
            climate of mutual concern, respect and caring. JIMS is committed to promoting a rich learning
            environment that is free of violence, discrimination, harassment and other barriers to students
            learning, healthy growth and development. All members of the JIMS community are expected to
            conduct themselves in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of others. 
        </P>
        <h5>Nondiscrimination Statement</h5>    
        <p>
            JIMS College intentionally creates a welcoming and inclusive learning community in which all
            members recognize and respect the rights and human dignity of every other member. The College
            values diversity and seeks talented students, faculty and staff from a variety of backgrounds. In
            keeping with its long-standing Catholic Franciscan foundations, JIMS College does not
            discriminate against any student, employee or applicant on the basis of any individual's age,
            citizenship, color, disability, gender, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital
            status, military status, national origin or ancestry, pregnancy or parenting status, political belief or
            affiliation, race, religion or creed (except in campus ministry staff positions), sex, sexual orientation,
            or veteran's status in the administration of its educational programs and activities or in its
            employment practices. Furthermore, the College prohibits the harassment of students and
            employees, as harassment is a form of discrimination. <br><br>
            In the area of undergraduate enrollment, JIMS College's weekday undergraduate programs will
            remain exclusive in respect to gender identity, but not as to any of the other aforementioned
            characteristics. 
            <br><br>
            JIMS College, an institution dedicated to the education of women, pays particular attention to 
            issues of harassment, discrimination or violence on the basis of sex, gender, pregnancy or parenting
            status. Conduct, whether intentional or unintentional, that results in discrimination, harassment, or violence
            toward a student or employee is illegal and unacceptable, undermining the mission of the college. Such conduct, 
            whether on or off campus, is expressly prohibited by the college and is considered a serious violation of human rights. 
            <br><br>
            In alignment with federal Title IX regulations, JIMS College has procedures to receive,
            investigate, respond to and resolve complaints of discrimination, including harassment based on
            gender. Title IX violations include discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, gender identity,
            gender expression, and sexual orientation, and include sexual harassment, sexual exploitation,
            nonconsensual sexual acts, and sexual misconduct. This policy applies to conduct between men and
            women or between members of the same sex. In this policy, “discrimination,” refers generically and
            inclusively to all forms of discrimination based on sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual
            exploitation, sexual assault and sexual violence. Sexual misconduct includes but is not limited to
            conduct prohibited at Wisconsin Statutes 940.225. 
            <br>
            This document outlines the investigation procedures by JIMS College in response to allegations
            of gender-based misconduct and sexual harassment involving one or more JIMS College
            students. Students who are on leave (disciplinary or otherwise), on a study abroad, or internship will
            be considered an JIMS College student, unless a student has terminated their relationship with the college.
